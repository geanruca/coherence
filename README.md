# Laravel Coherence

**Laravel Coherence** is a developer tool that uses AI (via [Prism](https://github.com/prism-php/prism)) to validate whether the attributes of your Eloquent models are logically coherent before they are saved. It's useful for catching absurd or invalid values early, especially in data-critical applications.
